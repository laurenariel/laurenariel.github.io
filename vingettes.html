  <p>Almost three years ago, I moved from a two-mile-wide town to one of the world’s biggest melting pots - and was surprised by the humanity found in the sprawling streets, the humility within the smog. Often times I think city concrete can make its inhabitants just as hardened, but I have always been a believer in what I see as the natural human state - unedited, unadulterated hope. Not capital “H” hope, but hope in the mundane, in the knowledge that we are alive, in the small victories we choose to win everyday despite the odds being stacked against us. I have often heard that journalism, and by that extent storytelling, is not supposed to feel, to be biased in its catering to the idea of hope. I have often thought that as wrong. The world was not made to stand still, to be merely observed from behind glass. It was made with the soul intention of feeling its existence. I have found the rawest form of living within the streets of New York, and in the least melodramatic way possible, it has made me a better person. This zine is an homage to a few of the souls I have met in my time here, who have touched my heart in a way that I’ll always remember. To me, these people are more than a diversity checkbox or a feel-good Instagram grab. They are raw, they are human, they are utterly and devastatingly and deliciously whole.</p>
