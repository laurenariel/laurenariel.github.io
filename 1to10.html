  <blockquote>The purpose of this project is to visualize what it is like to live with autoimmune, and to the same extent, chronic pain. This pain is invisible yet is still classified as “physical”; those who live with it must reconcile themselves within the liminal space between pain and recovery. A space that by definition is perpetually gray and stagnant. There is growth, but it is not necessarily linear, like pi. The title of this piece is "From One To Ten", based off of the test most physicians use to measure physical pain: one being barely able to feel it, and ten being paralyzed by pain. In theory, this makes sense because regular pain is fleeting, therefore it wanes and waxes within a very fixed timeline. However, chronic pain does not behave this way. Chronic pain can start anywhere from five to seven, and can go up to an unknowable number depending on the ailment; therefore it is asinine to expect those with chronic pain to quantify their suffering between just one to ten. I was texting one day with Max Gaddis, a dear friend and someone who is also featured in this project. As we were talking. she sent me a meme of someone answering pi (3.14) as an answer to the pain scale test, with the reasoning being that the pain was "low-level, never-ending" - and it became the perfect analogy for this project. Because pi is infinite, technically everything and nothing can be contained inside of it. Therefore, if someone were to answer with pi, it would be fitting because the potential for simultaneous "worst" and "least" pain are both possible in that context. It is the purest form of ironic paradox: those who live with chronic pain are constantly working towards the goal of “recovery”, as all people who are injured are. But the reality of a pain that never truly goes away means we are endlessly chasing a solution that doesn’t exist, at least not for us. We are in a space of transformation, but we are stuck in that we are always transforming, yet never recover. We are Sisyphus, pushing our primordial burdens up the mountain, never seeing rest.</blockquote>

      <h1 class="heading">How We Heal</h1>
      <h2><i>A Photo Essay</i></h2>
      <br>
      <blockquote>The following is a photo essay depciting the bodies and faces of those who live with four different types of autoimmune illnesses: Celiac Disease and PCOS, eczema, ulcerative colitis, and Chron's Disease. The purpose of these photographs is not to make the illness the forefront; but rather how these individuals heal themselves from a pain that is constant. There has been a push in recent years to romanticize and aestheticize self-care; the now-famous store Lush being one example of how self-healing practices are now supposed to be viewed as beautiful, even luxurious. But what about when self care is not beautiful? What about when self care means taking seven different types of medication, or missing out on outings with friends, or throwing up until you feel better after sticking a needle in your leg? For those who live with chronic pain, self-care means something a whole lot different. The following images depict the various methods and avenues people with chronic pain decide to heal themselves. The purpose of these images is to not show these women as weak, but rather to call attention to the strength that comes from knowing how to take care of their bodies in the way that they need. According to the American Autoimmune and Related Diseases Association, around 20% of all Americans have an Autoimmune Disease. Of that number, 75% are female-bodied people. This is a way to conceptualize just a few of the women who live within that 75%</blockquote>
