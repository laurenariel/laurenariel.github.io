      <h3><strong>WHEN IT IS OVER WE WILL CELEBRATE</strong></h3>

      <p>The contents of this project were created during a dark period of world history. The coronavirus pandemic has become infamous unto itself, with its death toll alone enough to make one eternally somber. It is a time of deep mourning, suffering, and loss. But it has also been a time of reconciliation, of healing and of community, even at its smallest moments. This book was created with that last point in mind. Its contents were created in a space of true sadness: of fear, uncertainty, and death. But the contents themselves tell of the human aspects to even an inhumane global pandemic, of the significance of family, and of the mundane and sometimes ugly side of everyday life that does not, or rather, cannot, stop just because the world is in peril. This is a story of everyday life that continues in spite of peril. This story follows the Hesses, an Italian-American family from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania as they struggle through their own personal wars. It follows Wendy, 58 and the mother of the family, as well as her children, Phillip, 33, Carolyn 29, and her daughter Anya, six, Rachael, 21, and Connor, 18, as they navigate the throws of divorce, relocation, miscarriage, disability, and mental health both apart and together, even as a global pandemic wreaks havoc on the world. Mentioned are Wendy’s ex-husband Ron, 58, and her middle son, Ryan, 24, who did not pass through the house during this time period.
      This story also chronicles a poignant moment in my own personal history. In March 2020, I came to visit Rachael for spring break, as I normally do, only expecting to stay for two weeks. I ended up living with them for five months, finding my own living situation less than favorable.
      They took me in without hesitation. I have known the Hesse family since 2015, a year after they moved to Phoenixville, but was surprised and deeply moved by their kindness and willingness to support me even through their own strife.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Being given someone else’s soul is a privilege and responsibility that I had never seen as an oppportunity for self-reflection, rather as just a way to hold space. This story changed that. The ability to learn, to grow, to change with a group of people over a year is an experience that is unique to few storytellers, and I am eternally lucky to have been given the chance to experience such intimacy, such trust, and such raw love. Simply stated, I hope it impacts you as much as it has impacted me.
      These photographs follow the five months I lived with the Hesse family, and the seven months after where I was allowed to be a part of their bubble.</p>

      <br>

      <p>This story was written under mentor by Kia Gregory, for our senior capstone class in the spring 2021 semester. It will become available for pre-order as a physical book in the coming months.

          <p class="subhed2"><strong>The last time Wendy had a house this full of children was 2015, one year after she moved her family from Danbury, CT. Itwas shortly after her eldest son, Kenny, 31, passed away from a heart attack. Carolyn, Anya, Geoffrey, Wendy’s sister Suzy, and her daughter Elise, her ex-husvand Ron, Ryan, Rachael, and Connor were all living in the house together. To say Wendy was prepared would be an understatement. Piles upon piles of non-perishables, perishables yet to be put away, cooling baked goods and prepped dinners dotted the counters. Mountains of dishes arose in the sink, which were a nightly fight between the family, even before quarantine. There were weekly grocery trips, which proved hectic due to mass panic-buying. Wendy’s then-boyfriend, Felix Grau (pictured bottom right) helped with shopping trips - accompanying Wendy and even paying for dinner some nights. With a six year old, a pregnant woman, and three young adults in the house, there was rarely a moment where the kitchen was empty.</strong></p>

Thinking it was a muscle strain, she was benched, but otherwise did not change her routine. By the end of February, she could barely bend over to tie her shoes. Because of the shelter-in-place, she was not able to see a physician or get to a hospital to figure out what was wrong, leaving her with Bengay and painkillers as her only option. She spent much of the first few months of quarantine on the couch or in her bed, unable to walk upright.In addition to her physical health, Rachael’s mental health was suffering. At school she had begun getting a diagnosis for her untreated Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and chronic depression. She had just been about to receive medication when she came home to Pennsylvania, upon which she found out her psychiatrist was unable to practice outside of D.C., leaving her to start the process over again with a new doctor.</strong></p>

They had been married at 18, when she found out she was pregnant with Kenny. In 2016, Ron wrote her a note, and walked out of the front doors of 471 Springview Lane. Since then, Wendy has been trying to sell the house, but has faced many obstacles - mainly financial ones. She had worked as a middle school teacher for fifteen years, while Ron had worked for the pharmaceutical company Perdue. When he left, she was supporting her five-child family on a teacher’s salary. In January 2020, she received a cease and desist letter from Ron’s lawyer, but due to the housing market and her own desire, decided to stay an extra year in the house.</strong></p>

On New Years Eve 2020, Carolyn found out she was pregnant again, after suffering the miscarriage of her second child the previous September. The night she announced it to Wendy and Rachael was the same night Governor Tom Wolf announced Pennsylvania’s month-long lockdown. Fearing her town in Virginia Beach, VA would become a police state, she remained with Wendy, leaving her husband Geoffrey alone as an essential worker as a commercial truck mechanic.</p>

When Wendy and Ron divorced in 2018, the stipulation was that he would cover child support, college tuition for Rachael and Connor, help to sell both their Connecticut house and eventually this one, and file the taxes he had neglected to: which was the ultimate cause of their separation. Wendy had received little to no financial help, making her the sole provider. By the summer, both she and Rachael were working two jobs to support the extra medical bills.</strong></p>

      <h3><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></h3>

      <p>First and foremost I would like to thank the Hesse family, for allowing me into their lives and into their personal moments. You have given me a trust I do not carry lightly.</p>

      <br>
	
		<p>I would like to thank my mentors, Kia Gregory and Allison Lichter-Joseph, for always encouraging my projects. Your continued support, even if we did not always agree, and insistence to think outside my proverbial lightbox has given me a confidence in my work I never thought was possible.</p>

		<br>

		<p>But mostly I would like to thank you, the named or nameless who have read these words, felt these photos, taken the time to pick up this project and sit with it. The coronavirus pandemic has changed our world for good - the way we interact and have been allowed to see one another has changed. We are in a time of mass grieving, and a dire need of empathy. Empathy is the hardest truth to learn and the most coveted ally once earned. But how we proceed in that empathy is up to us. The world has changed and so have we, who hold the unwitting accountable. It is my hope that this book touched you in some way, whether that be an emotion or a thought. I know the world is bereft of comfort, and there are days when it does not feel worth it to care. I have felt it on most days this year. But we must remember that we are all here together. That to be alive is to seek community. That to care is an act of righteousness. In the days that are coming in the aftermath of this global tragedy, the best we can do is hold each other’s hands. The Hesse family has held mine. Thank you for holding theirs.</p>
