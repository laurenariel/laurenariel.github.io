	<h1>From One To Ten</h1>
	<h2 id="head"><i>The Space Between Pain and Recovery</i></h2>
	<h3 id="tag">A Transmedia Project</h3>

	<img id="logo" src="Images/From One To Ten/logo.jpg">
	

	<p id="intro">The purpose of this project is to visualize what it is like to live with autoimmune, and to the same extent, chronic pain. This pain is invisible yet is still classified as “physical”; those who live with it must reconcile themselves within the liminal space between pain and recovery. A space that by definition is perpetually gray and stagnant. There is growth, but it is not necessarily linear, like pi. The title of this piece is "From One To Ten", based off of the test most physicians use to measure physical pain: one being barely able to feel it, and ten being paralyzed by pain. In theory, this makes sense because regular pain is fleeting, therefore it wanes and waxes within a very fixed timeline. However, chronic pain does not behave this way. Chronic pain can start anywhere from five to seven, and can go up to an unknowable number depending on the ailment; therefore it is asinine to expect those with chronic pain to quantify their suffering between just one to ten. I was texting one day with Max Gaddis, a dear friend and someone who is also featured in this project. As we were talking. she sent me a meme of someone answering pi (3.14) as an answer to the pain scale test, with the reasoning being that the pain was "low-level, never-ending" - and it became the perfect analogy for this project. Because pi is infinite, technically everything and nothing can be contained inside of it. Therefore, if someone were to answer with pi, it would be fitting because the potential for simultaneous "worst" and "least" pain are both possible in that context. It is the purest form of ironic paradox: those who live with chronic pain are constantly working towards the goal of “recovery”, as all people who are injured are. But the reality of a pain that never truly goes away means we are endlessly chasing a solution that doesn’t exist, at least not for us. We are in a space of transformation, but we are stuck in that we are always transforming, yet never recover. We are Sisyphus, pushing our primordial burdens up the mountain, never seeing rest. </p>

	<br>

	<p id="disc">For transparency's sake, I would like to add that I myself have an autoimmune illness, psoriatic arthritis, and it is from that which this project stems. However, these testimonies are untainted by my influence, save for a mutual understanding of one another's pain.</p>

	<h2 class="head"><i>An Installation</i></h2>

		<p class="description">The first part of this project took place on Tuesday, May 7th, 2019, in the courtyard of the Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. I had asked the four women I interviewed for this project to write me journal entries either refelcting on their weeks, or how they felt at the current moment. I then double exposed those photos onto portraits I had taken of them. The result became stunning collages that stood on their own as a testament to their pain. The purpose was to hear from the people who had experienced these illnesses firsthand, as a way to humanize often sterile statistics. I then pasted them into the courtyard on windows, with a journal beneath them on a table that had three entry prompts: "Tell Me How You're Feeling Today", "Rate Your Pain From One To Ten (And Tell Me Why)", and "What Does Pain Mean To You?". The goal was to start a conversation about pain; what it feels like, what it looks like, and how we might best understand it.</p>

	<h1><a name="parttwo">How We Heal</a></h1>
	<h3 id="head"><i>A Photo Essay</i></h3>

	<p class="description">The following is a photo essay depciting the bodies and faces of those who live with four different types of autoimmune illnesses: Celiac Disease and PCOS, eczema, ulcerative colitis, and Chron's Disease. The purpose of these photographs is not to make the illness the forefront; but rather how these individuals heal themselves from a pain that is constant. There has been a push in recent years to romanticize and aestheticize self-care; the now-famous store Lush being one example of how self-healing practices are now supposed to be viewed as beautiful, even luxurious. But what about when self care is not beautiful? What about when self care means taking seven different types of medication, or missing out on outings with friends, or throwing up until you feel better after sticking a needle in your leg? For those who live with chronic pain, self-care means something a whole lot different. The following images depict the various methods and avenues people with chronic pain decide to heal themselves. The purpose of these images is to not show these women as weak, but rather to call attention to the strength that comes from knowing how to take care of their bodies in the way that they need. According to the American Autoimmune and Related Diseases Association, around 20% of all Americans have an Autoimmune Disease. Of that number, 75% are female-bodied people. This is a way to conceptualize just a few of the women who live within that 75%.</p>

	<h3 id="head"><i>A Data Visualization</i></h3>

	<p class="description">For the last part to this project, I was curious to look into data of the different side effects of different immunotherapy drugs. Immunotherapy is a type of treatment under the biologics category of medication: essentially, they target specific chemicals in your body and alter them, to cure or treat things like inflammation or other things that should not be in the body. Immunotherapy targets the immune system as a whole, making the side effects, and the subsequent illnesses a compromised immune system can become succeptible to, far more dangerous than the actual illnesses themselves. In an attempt to visualize chronic pain in another way, I looked at three common categories of side effects I saw when looking through this data (taken from SIDER Side Effect Resource website): cancerous, mental health, and fatality.</p>
