    <h1>STATEMENT</h1>
    
      <div class="descbub" class="block">
        <p class="about">My mantle as a photojournalist is something I do not wear lightly. From pitch to print, I aim to do one thing and one thing only: dedicate myself to the telling of powerful stories, wherever they may come from. I have never believed in photography, and more closely journalism, as purely a hobby. I think too often in this world of abbreviations and buzzwords and blanket terms we have forgotten how to really speak to one another. I think we like to use colloquial phrases because they are easy, and keep us from thinking too hard or too long about what is actually there: and by that extension, I believe photography has also become a medium for making blanket statements about who people are. Today’s digital photography is so fast and easy that rarely do we ever pause to see what is in our viewfinders, the face or body we have just captured, the story behind the photo; and that as photographers, we do a disservice to our subjects when we do not take the time to truly <i>see</i> them. It has been my mission since deciding to become a professional photojournalist to actively combat the initial urge to click my shutter and move on – I want to soak in the stories of the world around me, bathe in their sorrow and happiness and <i>uncomfortability</i> and re-learn what it means to become human again. I think too often we become blind out of sheer protection from this world that can be so harsh, but I do not want to become apathetic to every beautiful emotion it has to offer. It is my hope that my work reflects this notion – not only for my readers, but my sources as well. I have always wanted this job to be a collaboration, not a dictatorship. I am no more mortal than the people I photograph, and I believe the first step into breaking barriers is to eliminate the idea that any one of us is better than the other. Hearing my sources makes me a better person. It is my hope that they speak to you as well.</p>

        <h1>BIO</h1>
      
    <div class="descbub">
        <p class="about">I grew up in a place called Phoenixville, Pennsylvania: a 2.5-mile-wide, blue-collar, steel-and-ironworks town known best for its artisanry and proximity to Valley Forge National Park. My tiny little town is covered in murals: the outside of buildings, the high school walls, the playgrounds, even the walls behind the hot tub graveyard have art on them. Our farmers market every Saturday under the High Bridge are a perfect metaphor for us: a bit of artisanry and handmade love, with a hint of old Amish and country charm. Downtown holds the only movie theatre in the area (The Colonial), where Harry Houdini once toured when it used to be a vaudeville house, as well as being the film site of the infamous running-out scene in the 1950’s cult classic “The Blob”. My elementary school was a Civil War hospital before it became a school, and the ironworks factory has become a beautiful homage to our town’s storied past and future – part event space, where I had my senior prom, and part museum. We have over nine town-wide events a year, including the Dogwood Fair, – plus the Dogwood Pageant and Parade, – BluesFest, BlobFest, the Food Truck Festivals, Phoenixville Pride, and the Firebird Festival, where one lucky student from the tech school gets to build a 60-foot Phoenix out of wood for the entire town to burn during the first week of December. It is safe to say I was surrounded by nothing but creativity, art, and history growing up. So, it is no wonder I became a photographer.</p>

        <p class="about">I was always creating things, even from a young age. 3 out of 4 of my grandparents were teachers, with my Mommom on my Mom’s side being an art teacher, and she was always encouraging me to create, to give into the tendencies and half-baked ideas she knew I already had inside me. I used to carry small Kodak disposable cameras with me everywhere I went, from random trips to the aquarium to family gatherings. Growing into high school, the stress of life had gotten tenfold, and I started to lose my spark of creativity. All I knew was that I wanted to write, to create. So I looked into journalism, and got nominated to go to the Washington Journalism and Media Conference in sophomore year of high school (2015). While there, I got to hear Pulitzer-Prize winning photojournalist Carol Guzy speak. Her words were powerful, her photos gut-wrenching. It spoke to me. I can still remember her saying the phrase that I still keep locked in my heart: <I>“It is our obligation to witness history, and to break the barrier of storytelling through intimacy.”</I> I bought my first DSLR with all the money I had in my bank account the day I got home from the conference.</p>

        <p class="about">Since then, I have taken over 10,000 photos. I started with dancers first, having my friends pose and move around me so I could figure out my settings. I had no equipment or system - just me and my subject. To this day, that is still how I prefer to do my photography. I made my own way of doing things, a craft that was completely my own. It felt good. I then got accepted to college, moved to New York City, and after some culture readjustment, dived headfirst into the world of photojournalism. Currently, I live in Bed-Stuy and am a rising junior, graduating 2021 from the New School, focusing my studies onto the intersection of art and journalism, and figuring out how to define this ever-changing career for myself.</p>
