    <h2 class="heading">Bio</h2>
     
     <p class="bs">Growing up in a mile-wide town, you tend to forget there's a whole world beyond you. That was what my life was like, living in a small town forty minutes west of Philadelphia, PA. A town called Phoenixville. Maybe some of you have heard of it: the 1950's cult classic "The Blob" was filmed at our beloved movie theatre The Colonial (of which I am both patron and employee), and our iron from the mill is shipped all around the world. The brand, Phoenix Iron Co., still burns on: our iron and steel support around 1,400 bridges built during the World Wars. Remnants of our grander days sit atop and inside our venues. The trapdoor out of which Harry Houdini once performed in our vaudeville days still sits beneath the main stage in The Colonial, hosting empty first chairs, waiting for their orchestra players to come back. The Columbia Hotel, once a bustling hub for travelers coming to us by way of railroad, houses new patrons now: families with children looking for a bite to eat, lovers on first dates tipsy with wine. The tops of our apartment complexes have inscriptions written from before the 1900's, with crown moldings and Aristotlean architecture. Pieces of our history that we no longer see, for we are too focused on what is in front of us. Our downtown shops host local artists, bakers, candlestick makers, the sides of them painted with murals from the steel age. Ten minutes down the road and there's Valley Forge National Park, a constant reminder of a colonial history. For as long as I can remember, all I knew was our town. But I knew it had a history. So I began to learn. And listen. I began my journey of truth through the lens of my camera and the tip of my pen. There's only so much to do in a town that's a mile-wide, and the closer I was to graduating high school and leaving, the more claustrophobic I became. So I turned to what I had been taught: artistry through community. I began to carry a camera with me everywhere I went, began to question the people around me, to really get to know their stories. I started analyzing my town, my tiny tiny town that I began to realize was quite backwards in many ways. I began to learn. I have always had a kinship with writing; it just made sense to make it part of my life. My truth to follow, I started discovering, is that there are so many in the world who are not allowed to just <i>be</i>. Who have masks they must don, tasks they must perform, people they must be in order to get by. And I found myself wanting to look past that -- to see beyond the haze and into the soul. To this day, I still search for the soul of every person I meet.</p>

     <h2 class="heading">Statement</h2>

     <p class="bs">My work has been featured among the few-- mostly friends, family members, locals of my hometown who appreciate the territory a camera brings. I am happy to have this connection with them. I am a primarily self-taught photographer, starting my camera journey in 2015 after hearing a talk from Carol Guzy in Washington D.C, for the Washington Journalism and Media Conference. I went on to hear powerful women like Susan Goldberg and Hoda Kotb speak about the power of the truth and compassion. The true power of empathy. It resonated with something deep inside me. It was solidified in 2017, when I was asked to join one of National Geographic's student expeditions to Prague, Czech Republic. I learned from some of the most empathetic and powerful photographers in the industry, including Ami Vitale. Her radical kindness inspires me to this day to be a better person. I spent those two weeks immersing myself into the people of the Czech Republic, and came away with a newfound drive: to ask the hard questions, to be ferociously kind and empathetic, to learn all that I can about as many people as I can. It is a goal I am still working towards. Currently, I write for my university's publication, This New York, run by Kia Gregory and the Journalism and Design department at The New School, as well as write for myself. Moving to New York City has opened my eyes a lot. I believe a lot of the ignorance we have comes from a lack of truth, of understanding. I am finding myself consciously unlearning behaviours every day, asking questions of myself with the same ferocity I would anyone else. The tiny space I have made for myself in Bedford-Stuyvesant has become an oasis of self-analysis. I hope to continue to grow my mind as well as my heart. Through The New School and myself I have worked with a few organizations: namely Voices4, an LGBTQ+ activist group, and most recently GreenRoofsNYC, a research collective. Any of the work I did and will do for them or other organizations (photographs, videos, marketing campaigns, etc.) are a reflection of the stories I wish to tell as part of my craft. Any opinions voiced by myself or on this page are not reflective of any of the organizations, my university, or any publications I write for. I am an independent, freelance journalist, and as such, operate on self-transparency.</p>
