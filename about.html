        <p class="about">My mantle as a photojournalist is something I do not wear lightly. We live in a world of instant gratification, of news bites and snippets that are short, quick, and easy to digest, and I think in recent times that has forced us to forget how to truly speak to one another in a way that's meaningful. I think we like to use our collective situation as an excuse for surface level commitment, because things are being innundated too quickly for us to keep up: and I do not believe photography is exempt from this. Today’s photography is so fast and easy that rarely do we ever pause to see what is in our viewfinders, the face or body we have just captured, the story behind the photo; and that as photographers, we do a disservice to our sources when we do not take the time to truly <i>see</i> them. I think we all have a duty to actively combat the initial urge to click our shutters and move on. I want to soak in the stories of the world around me, bathe in their sorrow and happiness and <i>uncomfortability</i> and re-learn what it means to become human again. The world is complex and desolate and at times ruthless but so inexplicably beautiful - and I do not want to become apathetic, for fear of losing myself to the abyss. Because the reality is that there is no end in sight. Not without hard work and dedication and humility, and an understanding that we are all truly in this together. But if we rely on those around us, turn outwards and not in, choose community time and time again, well, I believe we'll all make it out alright. It is my hope that my work reflects this notion.</p>

        <p class="about">Ms. Hoffman is a Jewish disabled woman from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania - a 2.3 mile-wide town that's a mix of Amish and Philadelphia charm. In her hometown she gained the reputation of event and graduation photographer, offering her services to the town. The summer before she went off to college, Ms. Hoffman participated in the <i>National Geographic</i> Student Expedition trip to Prague, where she studied from internationally-acclaimed photojournalist Ami Vitale. She spent two weeks living in the Czech Republic learning urbanscape photography and basic documentary photography foundations. When she got accepted to college, she chose to move to New York, eventually settling in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in Brooklyn. She lived there for two years with her roommate<a class="link1" href="https://www.izqueerdo.com/">Michael Izquierdo.</a> While in Brooklyn, Ms. Hoffman learned the discipline of documentary photography, and the rigorous ethics of being a journalist. She transformed her craft from kistchy portraiture (though it is still her favorite style to shoot) to compelling narrative storytelling. During her time in the city, Ms. Hoffman covered protests, with the Climate Strikes in September 2019 being most notable. Ms. Hoffman has also been nationally published on Good Morning America, for an Op-Ed she wrote at the beginning of the COVID-19 quarantine. Ms. Hoffman was unfortunately forced to leave Brooklyn at the beginning of the lockdown, and moved back to Pennsylvania for her health. She now lives in Royersford, where she will continue to write and photograph during these unprecedented times.</p>
